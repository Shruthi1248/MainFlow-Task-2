# Data Manipulation with Pandas

# Overview
  This repository demonstrates Basic Data Manipulation Techniques using the Pandas Library in Python. This Task covers the following topics:

  - Loading a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
    
  - Filtering data based on conditions
    
  - Handling missing values
    
  - Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, count, etc.)
    
# Key Features

  CSV Loading: Load data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames with a single line of code.

  Data Filtering: Filter rows based on various conditions to focus on specific subsets of your data.

  Handling Missing Data: Handle missing values efficiently by filling or removing them.

  Summary Statistics: Compute statistical measures like mean, median, count, standard deviation, and more for numerical data.

# Usage

  Data Cleaning: Handle messy datasets by filling missing values or dropping irrelevant data.
  
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into your data using summary statistics to understand its distribution and trends.
  
  Data Filtering: Filter data based on conditions to focus on specific sections of a dataset for detailed analysis.
  
  Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data by handling missing values, filtering rows, and computing statistics as part of preprocessing steps.
